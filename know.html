<!-- Grid concept of Bootstrap -->
<div class="container"><!-- you can use header here and similarly nav in the below tag -->
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-4"></div>


	</div>
</div>

<!-- container basically contains the content and the grid , the row actually need to be defined because it helps in the alignment of the data in the grid with data outside the container.... col-SIZE-SPAN ..size is the limit upto which the columns are unstacked one upon other in that row and span is the number of columns screen is divided into 12 columns and span decides how many parts combine to give one column .. for size xs it will never collapse-->
